Simple PHP Interaction Test Scripts

The scripts contained in this small package are a collection of test scripts I've
used over the years to see how PHP interactions with my web browser and my web
server. They are generally pretty simple in nature and are built to be fast and
informative. There is very little security applied to any of these scripts and as
such should not really be used as is, in whole or in part, in any production 
environment. PLEASE DO NOT USE ANY OF THIS CODE IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT 
UNLESS YOU ARE VERY SURE THAT IT POSES NO SECURITY RISK TO YOUR ENVIRONMENT. I
CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

There is no license on this package or any of the code contained herein. You are
more than welcome to use it for whatever purpose you'd like, even if you don't 
want to give me credit. Of course, credit is always nice to receive, but it is 
not at all required. If you absolutely need to have a license in hand for some 
reason, find the least restrictive license available (something like a Creative
Commons license) and use that.
